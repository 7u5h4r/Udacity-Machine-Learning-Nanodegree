# HandWritten Digit Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition using python and Tensorflow

**Check out the blog post [here](http://hanzratech.in/python/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-opencv-sklearn-and-python/) for complete notes on how the code works.**

# Dependencies
1. `python`
2. `TensorFlow`
3. `numpy`

# Contents
This repository contains the following files and folders-

1. `data_d.py` - Python Script to download the MSIT database and pre-procoess it and split into training and testing sets  `data_d.pyc`.
2. `digit_rec` - Python Script for our training and prediction model.
3. `Report.pdf` - Project Report PDF File.
4. `data` - folder of preprocessed data.
5. `graph` - Folder of TensorFlow Graph Link to folder because file wass larger than 25mb:

## Usage 


* Run the digit_rec.py file to train and predict the model

## Results

~92% accuracy

## TODO
* Add a CNN Based approach
